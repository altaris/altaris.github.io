# Programming

* [**kappak**](https://github.com/altaris/kappak): My LaTeX package. It
  regroups functionalities I find useful, from general style of LaTeX documents
  (title page, chapter style, header / footer, …), to more specific math
  related commands (theorem environments, commutative diagrams, …).
  Consequently, it might not be as useful for you as it is for me, but you are
  welcome to give a try. [Wiki-that-might-or-might-not-be-up-to-date
  (￣ω￣;)](https://altaris.github.io/kappak/).

* [**s3backup**](https://github.com/altaris/s3backup): This docker image
  performs incremental backups of a given volume to an S3 storage using
  [restic](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
  [rclone](https://rclone.org/).

* [**fapy**](https://github.com/altaris/fapy): Fun (?) with finite automata in
  python. Available on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/altaris/fapy/master)
  (click on index.ipnb).

* [**potatos**](https://github.com/altaris/potatos): Personal OS experiment in
  C++. When you press a key it display what key you just pressed yay.

* [**SeAT Navy Issue**](https://github.com/altaris/seat-navy-issue): simpler
  alternative to [SeAT](https://github.com/eveseat/seat). In short, it is an
  EVE Online community manager, in the form of a REST API. Its core
  functionalities include: managing corporations, alliances, and even
  coalitions; creating and managing custom groups; storing and refreshing ESI
  tokens; making queries against the ESI; a simplistic clearance system; and a
  Discord and Teamspeak connector. Note that this project is just a backend.

# Personal notes and projects

* [**The Vector
  Convention**](https://github.com/altaris/vector-convention/raw/master/vector-convention.pdf)
  (2017): We introduce some conventions that promote shorter array handling
  notations.

* [**Notes on the Tensor Product of Axiomatized Algebraic Theories and their
  Stability**](https://github.com/altaris/notes-tensor-aat/raw/master/notes-tensor-aat.pdf)
  (2015): In this personal project, we investigate the categories encoding
  axiomatized algebraic theories, and the associated categories of models. A
  tensor product or theories is constructed, and we try to investigate the
  iterated tensor of a given theory. An algebraic invariant is constructed and
  computed for classical examples. It however turns out to be too weak for
  meaningful results.

* [**Quasi
  Categories**](https://hothanh.fr/cedric/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/09/projet-cht-ma2.pdf)
  (2014): This semester project introduces a first notion of (strict)
  ∞-categories via enrichment. Another approach, namely quasi categories, is
  then presented, along with results about the “homotopical category – nerve”
  adjunction. Finally, adjunctions in 2-categories, and limits in term of
  absolute lifting property are discussed.
