I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Prof. Takemasa Miyoshi's
[Prediction Science Laboratory](https://prediction.riken.jp/project_en.html),
[RIKEN Cluster for Pioneering Research](https://www.riken.jp/en/), Japan.

<!-- I am currently a project researcher at [Ichiro
Hasuo](http://group-mmm.org/~ichiro/)'s [ERATO Metamathematics for Systems
Design Project (ERATO MMSD)](https://group-mmm.org/eratommsd/) at the [National
Institute of Informatics (NII)](http://www.nii.ac.jp/en/) in Tokyo, Japan. -->

I obtained my PhD in mathematics from [Paris
University](https://u-paris.fr/en/), France, in October 2020, where I was a
student at the [Research Institute for Foundations of Computer Science
(IRIF)](https://www.irif.fr/en/index), under the supervision of [Pierre-Louis
Curien](https://www.irif.fr/~curien/) ([IRIF](https://www.irif.fr/en/index))
and [Samuel Mimram](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Samuel.Mimram/) ([LIX,
École Polytechnique](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/)). There, I was a member
of PPS team ([IRIF](https://www.irif.fr/en/index)) and [πr2
team](https://www.inria.fr/en/teams/pi.r2) of the [National Institute for
Research in Computer Science and Control (INRIA)](https://www.inria.fr/en).

I graduated with both a bachelor's and master's degree in mathematics from
[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/),
Switzerland. I wrote my master's thesis as an exchange student at the
[University of Copenhagen](http://www.ku.dk/english/), Denmark, under the
supervision of [Nathalie Wahl](http://web.math.ku.dk/~wahl/) and [Kathryn
Hess](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/hessbellwald-lab/hessbellwald/)
([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/)).
