I am currently a research engineer at [EAGLYS](https://eaglys.co.jp/).

<!-- I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Prof. Takemasa
Miyoshi](https://data-assimilation.riken.jp/~miyoshi)'s [Prediction Science
Laboratory](https://prediction.riken.jp/project_en.html) ([RIKEN Cluster for
Pioneering Research](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/cpr/)), and at [Dr.
Jun Seita](http://junseita.com/mt/bio.html)'s [Medical Data Deep Learning
Team](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/r-ih/adv_data_sci_proj/med_data_deep_learn/index.html)
([RIKEN Information R&D and Strategy Headquarters, Advanced Data Science
Project](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/r-ih/adv_data_sci_proj/index.html))
I am also a member of the [RIKEN Quantum](https://rq.riken.jp/en/) group. -->

<!-- I am currently a project researcher at [Ichiro
Hasuo](http://group-mmm.org/~ichiro)'s [ERATO Metamathematics for Systems
Design Project (ERATO MMSD)](https://group-mmm.org/eratommsd) at the [National
Institute of Informatics (NII)](http://www.nii.ac.jp/en) in Tokyo, Japan. -->

I obtained my PhD in mathematics from [Université Paris
Cité](https://u-paris.fr/en), France, in October 2020, where I was a student at
the [Research Institute for Foundations of Computer Science
(IRIF)](https://www.irif.fr/en/index), under the supervision of [Pierre-Louis
Curien](https://www.irif.fr/~curien) ([IRIF](https://www.irif.fr/en/index)) and
[Samuel Mimram](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Samuel.Mimram) ([LIX,
École Polytechnique](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr)). There, I was a member
of PPS team ([IRIF](https://www.irif.fr/en/index)) and [πr²
team](https://www.inria.fr/en/teams/pi.r2) of the [National Institute for
Research in Computer Science and Control (INRIA)](https://www.inria.fr/en).

I graduated with both a bachelor's and master's degree in mathematics from
[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch),
Switzerland. I wrote my master's thesis as an exchange student at the
[University of Copenhagen](http://www.ku.dk/english), Denmark, under the
supervision of [Nathalie Wahl](http://web.math.ku.dk/~wahl) and [Kathryn
Hess](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/hessbellwald-lab/hessbellwald)
([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch)).
