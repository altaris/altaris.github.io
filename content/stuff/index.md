# Projects

- [**Turbo Broccoli**](https://github.com/altaris/turbo-broccoli): A Python
  package containing JSON (de)serialization extensions. It makes it possible to
  embed `bytes`, `numpy` arrays, `keras` models,
  [etc.](https://cedric.hothanh.fr/turbo-broccoli/turbo_broccoli.html#supported-types)
  in a `dict` and seemlessly pass it on to `json.dump`, and conversely,
  reconstruct these objects using `json.load`.

- [**kappak**](https://github.com/altaris/kappak): My LaTeX package. It
  regroups functionalities I find useful, from general style of LaTeX documents
  (title page, chapter style, header / footer, …), to more specific math
  related commands (theorem environments, commutative diagrams, …).
  Consequently, it might not be as useful for you as it is for me, but you are
  welcome to give a try. [Wiki-that-might-or-might-not-be-up-to-date (￣ ω
  ￣;)](https://altaris.github.io/kappak).

- [**s3backup**](https://github.com/altaris/s3backup): This docker image
  performs incremental backups of a given volume to an S3 storage using
  [restic](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest) and
  [rclone](https://rclone.org).

- [**potatos**](https://github.com/altaris/potatos): Personal OS experiment in
  C++. When you press a key it display what key you just pressed yay.

- [**SeAT Navy Issue**](https://github.com/altaris/seat-navy-issue): simpler
  alternative to [SeAT](https://github.com/eveseat/seat). In short, it is an
  EVE Online community manager, in the form of a REST API. Its core
  functionalities include: managing corporations, alliances, and even
  coalitions; creating and managing custom groups; storing and refreshing ESI
  tokens; making queries against the ESI; a simplistic clearance system; and a
  Discord and Teamspeak connector. Note that this project is just a backend.

# Personal notes

- [**Stability of Lawvere Theories**](2021-stability-of-lawvere-theories.pdf),
  work in progress, 2021.

- [**Notes on monad with arities & parametric right
  adjoints**](2019-07-wtf-is-pra.pdf), 2019-07.

- [**Notes on Koszul duality**](2019-07-wtf-koszul.pdf), 2019-07.

- [**Notes on some Coq introduction and elimination
  rules**](2018-12-wtf-coq.pdf), 2018-12.

- [**The Vector
  Convention**](https://github.com/altaris/vector-convention/raw/master/vector-convention.pdf)
  , 2017: We introduce some conventions that promote shorter array handling
  notations.

- [**Quasi Categories**](2014-quasi-categories.pdf), 2014: This semester
  project introduces a first notion of (strict) ∞-categories via enrichment.
  Another approach, namely quasi categories, is then presented, along with
  results about the “homotopical category – nerve” adjunction. Finally,
  adjunctions in 2-categories, and limits in term of absolute lifting property
  are discussed.
